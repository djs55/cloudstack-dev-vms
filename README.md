cloudstack-dev-vms
==================

VMs and scripts to make cloudstack development easier.

So far there is:

* cloudstack-infrastructure: a VM which hosts mysql and NFS for
  primary/secondary storage and acts as a NAT router for the guest
  network
* xenserver-6.2: a XenServer 6.2 SP1 + hotfixes hypervisor
